    The poetics of Estrada proposes to shift the focus from personal biography and turn to the landscapes of the encounters that emerge along the road.
</p>
<p>
It pursues to capture the chant of various birds, birds that migrate and move together towards the same direction, and then depart on different routes. The compositions oscillate between the life stories of people who are on the road and the sensation of being collectively interwoven in a climate crisis.
</p>
<p>
Contemplative and profound, and also nostalgic yet hopeful, the poetics of this compositions narrate mystical and mundane episodes of everyday life, passing through the complexities and crises of our time, like climate issues and forced migration, or the nostalgia of being far away from home.

<p>
"These songs, some in Spanish and others in Portuguese, began during the "Corpo Aldea" European tour, a moment of nomadism that was transformed into the total stillness that the pandemic brought us".
