  Description:
  - In 2020 the project "Delving into South American folk music" was born in cooperation
    with Klangfolk e.V., a cultural association based in TÃ¼bingen. Different aspects
    of South American music have been studied since.
  - The meetings are based on body percussion exercises to delve into the new rhythms,
    the oral teaching of melodies and finally bring these songs to each instrument.
  - Songs from Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia have been studied in the workshops
    and the journey is still under way.
  - The workshops are free to anyone in the world who wants to join. To participate,
    get in touch!
