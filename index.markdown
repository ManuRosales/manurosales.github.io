                With a contemporary view over songwriting, <span class="bold">Manu Rosales</span> creates an eclectic universe of sounds. His guitar evokes different roots of the world, from the folklore of Argentina, passing through the Andes and Brazil and reaching the Northwest of Africa.

                Manu's nomadic curiosity has inspired him to delve into multiple cultures, which shines through in his lyrics and music. Contemplative and profound, and also nostalgic yet hopeful, the poetics of his compositions narrate mystical and mundane episodes of everyday life, passing through the complexities and crises of our time, like climate issues and forced migration, or the nostalgia of being far away from home.
            </p>

                Manu has successfully presented his first álbum <span class="bold">“Cuerpo Aldea”</span> in Europe in 2019, touring in Barcelona, Lisbon, Porto, Brussels, Ghent, Strasbourg and Tübingen. Currently he is post-producing his second album <span class="bold">“Estrada”</span>, which will be launched in Summer 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 2020 he has been conducting the project <span class="bold">"Delving into South American Folk Music"</span> in cooperation with Klangfolk e.V., a Tübingen based cultural associacion, in which he shares different aspects of South American music.
