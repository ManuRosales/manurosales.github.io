- 'Manu Rosales is a distinctive voice in contemporary songwriting, crafting an eclectic
  blend of global musical traditions that span from Argentine folklore and Andean
  sounds to Brazilian rhythms and North African influences. His guitar-playing and
  lyrics reflect a deep curiosity for diverse cultures, blending contemplative poetics
  with a nuanced exploration of the complexities and crises of our time.

'
- 'Since the release of his debut album Cuerpo Aldea, Manu has brought his music to
  Europe, with performances in Barcelona, Lisbon, Porto, Brussels, Ghent, Strasbourg,
  and Tübingen during his 2019 tour. In 2022, he launched a successful pre-release
  tour to promote his second album Estrada, performing across Portugal, Germany, Belgium,
  Switzerland, Slovenia, Italy, and France.

'
- 'In 2025, Manu is set to embark on the anticipated Tour Encuentro alongside his
  trio, featuring renowned Chilean musicians Francisco Martinez on bandoneon and Laura
  Campos on violin. This tour will bring their evocative music to venues across Europe,
  offering audiences an immersive live experience. Rooted in the concept of encounters
  between people, cultures, and sounds, Tour Encuentro explores themes of forced migration,
  the search for home, and the challenges posed by global humanitarian and climate
  crises.

'
- Currently pursuing a master’s degree at the prestigious Sibelius Academy, University
  of the Arts Helsinki, Manu continues to evolve artistically. His intimate voice
  and guitar are brought to life by the masterful accompaniment of Francisco Martinez’s
  soulful bandoneon and Laura Campos’ emotive violin, creating a dynamic musical dialogue
  that transcends borders and genres
- Rosales' collaboration with Brazilian clarinetist and singer Stephanie Kobori in
  the Koiro Duo adds a further dimension to his work, merging original compositions
  with traditional music from Brazil and Argentina. Together, these projects highlight
  Manus' global appeal, drawing from diverse influences and offering audiences a unique
  reflection on culture, migration, and the human condition.
